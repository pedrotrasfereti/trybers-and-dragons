<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## RPG With SOLID Architecture and OOP

Welcome to the _GitHub repository_ of my eigth back-end project, **Trybers and Dragons**!
Here you can find information about the project's development, such as which technologies were used, how to get a local copy, usage and more.

This back-end application was developed during my time at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) to practice the lessons learned on **S.O.L.I.D.** architecture and
Object Oriented Programming (**OOP**).

In this fantasy universe, you can play as one of the four archetypes ‚Äî `Mage`, `Necromancer`, `Ranger` and `Warrior`, each one possessing either the **mana** or **stamina** energy types ‚Äî 
as well as belong to one of the humanoid races: `Dwarf`, `Elf`, `Halfling` and `Orc`. Every character will be unique, each possessing different **strength**, **defense**, **dexterity** and **energy** points.
Non-humanoid `Monsters` also inhabit the planet. You may test your luck with them in a _player versus player_ (**PVP**) `battle` üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚öîÔ∏è.

<br>

During the development I was able to:

* Understand and apply the principles of the **OOP** paradigm: `Abstraction`, `Encapsulation`, `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`.
* Exercise the use of `Composition`;
* Exercise the creation and usage of `Interfaces`;
* Implement, in TypeScript: `Classes`, `Instances`, `Attributes`, `Methods` and `Objects`;
* Exercise knowledge through the application of **S.O.L.I.D.** principles.
